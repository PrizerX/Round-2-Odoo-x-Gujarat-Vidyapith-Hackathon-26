# 🚀 Learnova Hackathon Sprint Plan (24h)

## Rules To Consider

- Strict UI tokens applied (Primary `#714b67`, Accent `#f3f4f6`, Base `#ffffff`).
- All Add/Edit actions must use modals; all Delete actions must have confirmation.
- Local Auth + Local DB required (no Supabase); users are persisted in local SQLite (Prisma).
    - Course catalog/content is still mock-driven (until Module A CRUD is wired).
    - Learning state is DB-first when signed-in (attempts/reviews/progress/points), with cookie/localStorage fallback kept for MVP robustness.
- This TaskList mirrors the provided Learnova Architecture sections (Module A + Module B).
- Publishing: only published courses are visible to learners.
- Guests can browse (if allowed) but must sign in to start learning.

## ✅ Completed so far
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind scaffolded in repo root.
- Basic UI kit primitives created: Button/Card/Input/Modal/ConfirmDialog.
- Route groups created for `(learner)` and `(backoffice)`.
- Auth pages split into `/auth/sign-in` and `/auth/sign-up` (DB-backed auth; session stored in `learnova_session` cookie).
- Role-based protection added for `/backoffice/*` (instructor/admin only).
- Learner navbar shows Courses + auth status (Sign in / user + Logout).
- Learner discovery `/courses` implemented with dynamic CTA (Join/Start/Continue/Buy).
- Join-first UX: open courses require explicit Join before learning; player route is gated to prevent bypass.
- Learner `/my-courses` implemented with progress cards + total points + badge (trimmed to 4 demo items).
- Learner `/profile` implemented with badge ladder (Newbie → Master).
- Learner course details `/courses/[courseId]` redesigned to match raw mockup (banner + cover + square thumbnail placeholders, progress/stats card, tabs, searchable content list).
- Learner player `/learn/[courseId]/[lessonId]` redesigned to match raw mockup (left course panel + right viewer pane).
- YouTube video embeds wired for video lessons (placeholder URLs supported).
- Proper quiz flow implemented (start → questions → results modal) with simple scoring.
- Quiz completion marks course as 100% complete across learner pages (demo persistence via httpOnly cookie + API route).
- Quiz points now sync into `/my-courses` + `/profile` totals (demo persistence via httpOnly cookie).
- Points now start at 0 (no mock base points).
- Demo utility: “Reset progress” button on course details clears completion + points for a course (DB + cookie/localStorage) and redirects back to details.
- Visual polish: green progress indicators everywhere; paid price emphasized; “Enrolled” ribbon shown on catalog cards.
- Course images now support 3 distinct URLs: cover (landscape), banner (wide header), thumbnail (square). Upload UI is deferred to Module A.

## Local Auth + Local DB (NEW requirement — no Supabase)

Goal: persist users (and later learning data) using a local database while **keeping the existing** `/api/auth/*` endpoints and the `learnova_session` cookie shape so current flows don’t break.

### L1) Database & ORM setup
- [x] Pick DB engine for hackathon runtime:
    - [x] SQLite via Prisma (fastest local setup)
    - [ ] OR Postgres local/Docker (best parity)
- [x] Add Prisma to the project (`prisma/`, `schema.prisma`, migrations)
- [x] Create seed script to insert demo users (learner/instructor/admin)
- [x] Create core platform DB schemas (Course/Lesson/Quiz/Progress/Review/etc.) + seed a few demo rows (UI wiring pending)
- [x] Add `.env` with `DATABASE_URL` (+ app secret if signing sessions)

### L2) Auth persistence (compatible migration)
- [x] Update `/api/auth/signup` to create a DB user (unique email) + hash password
- [x] Update `/api/auth/login` to verify password hash against DB
- [x] Keep `/api/auth/me` + `/api/auth/logout` behavior unchanged
- [ ] (Optional but recommended) Sign the session cookie to prevent tampering (keep same session payload contract)

### L3) Learning persistence (incremental, after L1–L2)
- [x] Move reviews persistence from localStorage → DB (per-course, per-user) via `/api/reviews` (localStorage kept as fallback/cache)
- [x] Move quiz attempts from localStorage → DB (per-course, per-quiz, per-user) via `/api/learning/attempt` (localStorage fallback)
- [x] Move completion + points from cookies → DB (store by userId + courseId)
- [x] Keep cookie-based behavior as a temporary fallback during migration
